The games are cool and everyone loves them. Making games can be very different from other types of programming. In this article, I will walk you through how to create a game with the Python programming language.

How To Create a Game?\
As a programmer, when creating games you have to think more about the logic of the game. The logic of the game is the heart and soul of your game. It defines the game world, what things are in the universe and how they interact. It also defines how the state of the game can be altered by external stimuli, such as a human player pressing a button on the gamepad or an AI process taking action to kill you.\
There are now so many programming languages that you can use to build a game. But the best choice is to use the C++ programming language. But since Python is in high demand and Python newbies don’t know much about the tasks that can be done with Python, so in the section below I will take you through how to make a game with Python.

Create a Game with Python\
Now let’s see how to create a game with Python. I am going to create a very simple game based on a fidget spinner. The logic of the game is that the turns will keep increasing as you press the space bar, and it will reduce its speed and stop at a point where you stop pressing the space bar.

To create a game with Python based on the above logic of a fidget spinner I will use the Turtle module in Python
